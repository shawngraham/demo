This camera has only USAAF numbers and markings. The K-series camera appears to have been the model of aerial camera favoured by the USAAF during the interwar period 1920-1942 Aerial photography has been used "for mapping, charting of the sea coasts, building of highways, town planning and any ground activity where a measure of size or change must be made. Aerial photography provided the first true measure of the size and physical makeup of the surface of Canada. It has played a vital role in major engineering developments such as the Trans-Canada Highway and the St. Lawrence Seaway. Aerial photography proved invaluable in the opening of the North and in the evaluation of Canada's forest resources."","Aerial photography.","When the US entered WW2, the K-3 (Graflex/Fairchild) was replaced by the improved K-17 model. The K-17 has a shorter focal length than later cameras and was used for lower altitude reconnaissance in faster fighter aircraft (e.g. P-38). It appears that most of the patents found on the camera were assigned to the Fairchild Aviation Corp.~ however, both Graflex and Fairchild built these cameras.","Photography","Still cameras","Specialized","Exploration and Survey","Photogrammetry","Photographic equipment","Aviation","Miscellaneous","","metal->steel~glass->~synthetic->~skin->leather~fibre","50.0 cm","44.0 cm","31.5 cm","","","","http://source.techno-science.ca/artifacts-artefacts/images/1966.0048.001.aa.cs.png","http://source.techno-science.ca/artifacts-artefacts/images/1966.0048.001.aa.cs.thumb.png"

The hub contained the wheel bearing, which was packed with grease. The hub cap was a small device used to cover the center hub to keep the dust out and the grease in. Eventually, car manufacturers replaced the wooden spokes with steel wire spokes in the 1920s and 1930s. As a result the hub cap evolved into a wheel cover, which is a large disc that covers most of the wheel. Wheel covers continue to serve a functional purpose but they have also become a decorative design feature of the wheel .","Motorized Ground Transportation","Automotive parts","Hubcaps","","","","","","","metal->brass","","9.0 cm","3.6 cm","","","","http://source.techno-science.ca/artifacts-artefacts/images/1966.0068.001.aa.cs.png","http://source.techno-science.ca/artifacts-artefacts/images/1966.0068.001.aa.cs.thumb.png"

Canadian Vickers was commissioned to build an initial four aircraft under license and these were the first all-metal stressed-skin aircraft to be built in Canada. The Delta used the same wing as the Gamma, had split flaps and a non-retractable undercarriage like its predecessors. The larger fuselage accommodated up to eight passengers. For RCAF use, the design was modified to accept three Fairchild A-3 cameras at the rear of the cabin. The cabin floor was strengthened to accept freight loads and a large upward opening freight door was installed on the port side. Two Deltas were armed with a defensive machine gun fitted in an open hatch in the roof. Protection from the slipstream was provided by a plexiglas fairing. This particular installation was not very satisfactory causing buffeting and a marked decrease in performance.","Aviation","Aircraft","","","","","","","","metal->aluminum~metal->steel~resin->rubber","9.8 M","14.6 M","","","","","http://source.techno-science.ca/artifacts-artefacts/images/1966.0069.001.aa.cs.png","http://source.techno-science.ca/artifacts-artefacts/images/1966.0069.001.aa.cs.thumb.png"

This was a type of sailing warship developed out of a desire for a vessel which could hold much artillery and still be a capable (fully-rigged) sailing ship. Its superstructures were reduced considerably from that of the Carrack, and further reduced from that of the Galleon. However, aspects of the Galleon may be seen in this vessel such as the beak, low forecastle and poop rising in steps. The reduction in superstructure reduced its draft and made it easier to handle. However, there were still problems (see below), as the Sovereign was supposedly the largest and most heavily armed vessel built to that date, with 100 guns. The "royals" which were probably set only while the vessel was on parade, were first used on this vessel and hence their name ["Royal Sovereign" after rebuilding in 1659]. It was also the most lavishly decorated with ornamentation designed by Van Dyck, and its stern was round up until about 10 feet above the water line. Before this time, all British as well as other European ships were built with a flat transom.","Marine Transportation","Models","Historical artifact","","","","","","","wood~metal~fibre~glass","125.0 cm","38.5 cm","105.5 cm","","","","http://source.techno-science.ca/artifacts-artefacts/images/1966.0141.001.aa.cs.png","http://source.techno-science.ca/artifacts-artefacts/images/1966.0141.001.aa.cs.thumb.png"
