I've made a new note with ctrl + n; I've hit the insert template button whilst inside the new note, to get the template materials inserted, as below. I've modified, written my thoughts. Now I go to the file explorer / finder


# Introduction 

## Resonances

_quote with citation from the readings and podcast (if appropriate) that resonates for you. Remember that > marks a quotation in markdown
	- optional: explain why

## Response to the Prompts

_you can respond explicitly to the prompts, or consider what the biggerr issue is that the prompts are driving at, and respond to that. Connect what you did with what you read/thought._
