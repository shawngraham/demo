The fresco area is pretty worn and the details of the faces are not visible; the figures can be identified by color variations not being well traced even the outline drawing; the crenellated walls that form the background appear as a single defensive wall; probably at the time of the discovery La Volpe saw some detail over and maybe I interpret\u00f2 others.\n\n",
